# designpatterns
Prepared this repo for a guest lecture at SIT, Pune to teach Computer Science engineering students about design patterns. </br>
It includes code examples for Adapter, Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Iterator and Decorator design patterns. </br>
To make the discussion interesting and interactive, the examples are based on a theme of a video aggregator app. 
The examples demonstrate how patterns can solve various design challenges faced while developing such an app.
